An automated, monitored ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for fictional tote manufacturer TerrificTotes.

## üåê Overview

TerrificTotes's existing commercial and production systems store data in a write-optimized PostgreSQL database, unsuited to querying by analysts. `gb-terrifictotes-dcf` spins up a complete ecosystem of AWS cloud services in order to process new data from this database at regular intervals. Data is: 

- ingested for storage in JSON files; 
- denormalized and transformed into a new, OLAP-friendly schema, saved in parquet format; and finally 
- loaded into a data warehouse, ready for querying and integration into BI dashboards.

Change history is maintained from the moment of the pipeline's first operation. All stages are monitored, and basic error reporting triggers email notifications on system failure.

## üïπÔ∏è Demo

Every 15 minutes, a new pipeline execution begins. Any rows added to the source database since the time of the last check are ingested into an S3 bucket as JSON packets, named with the start time of the current execution and arranged in folders according to origin table.

<p align="center"><img src="./docs/images/ingestion-bucket.png" alt="ingestion bucket" />       <img src="./docs/images/ingestion-sales-order.png" style="padding-bottom: 20px" alt="ingested sales_order packets" /></p>

Output from the ingestion stage lists which tables do and don't have updates along with the current check time, in a clear, human-readable format ideal for either automatic or manual recovery from logs in case of errors.

<p align="center"><img src="./docs/images/ingestion-output.png" alt="ingestion output" /></p>

The processing stage fetches the indicated packets, transforming the data and saving it to a second S3 bucket with a new folder structure reflecting the star schema of the destination warehouse. At present, `gb-terrifictotes-dcf` delivers a minimum viable product covering a single facts table.

<p align ="center"><img src="./docs/images/processing-bucket.png" style="padding-bottom: 57px" alt="processing bucket" /> <img src="./docs/images/processing-fact-sales-order.png" alt="processed fact_sales_order packets" /></p>

<p align="center"><img src="./docs/images/processing-output.png" alt="Processing output" title="Processing output" /></p>

All operations on the ingestion and processing buckets are write-only. Updates to existing records are processed as new rows, with `last_updated` date and time columns establishing chronology. Intelligent handling of destination tables constructed using data from two or more interrelated source tables ensures quality and integrity of data.

Finally, the transformed data is loaded into the data warehouse. It can now be queried, analyzed and visualized using Power BI, QuickSight, Superset, Streamlit, or another tool of your choice.

## üìú Prerequisites

This project requires:

1. Python (3.9 <= version <= 3.12.4)

2. The [git CLI](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

3. [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli) (developed using version 1.10.2)

4. An [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/free/)

5. [AWS credentials configured locally](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html), including access keys and default region

6. An [S3 bucket](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) for remote storage of Terraform state files

7. A PostgreSQL OLTP database organized according to [the expected schema](./docs/images/oltp-db.png), accessible remotely via public IP or URL and receiving frequent ongoing updates

8. A second PostgreSQL database, accessible remotely via public IP or URL, which will be used for the data warehouse

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

### üèóÔ∏è Project Setup

[Fork the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo?platform=linux&tool=webui) on GitHub.

Clone it to your local system.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME-HERE/gb-terrifictotes-dcf
```

Change into the directory.

```sh
cd gb-terrifictotes-dcf
```

Install dependencies and set up the development environment.

```sh
make requirements && make dev-setup
```

### üîê Secure Credentials Setup

[Create two AWS Secrets Manager secrets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/hardcoded.html#hardcoded_step-1), both in the following format. In one secret, store credentials for the OLTP PSQL database. In the other, store credentials for the data warehouse.

```json
{
  "PG_USER": "YOUR_USERNAME_HERE",
  "PG_PASSWORD": "YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE",
  "PG_HOST":"YOUR_PSQL_IP_OR_URL_HERE",
  "PG_DATABASE":"YOUR_DATABASE_NAME_HERE",
  "PG_PORT":"5432"
}
```

In `src/ingestion_lambda.py`, update `connect_to_db()` with the name of the secret containing the OLTP credentials.

```python
credentials = retrieve_secret(sm_client, "YOUR-OLTP-SECRET-NAME-HERE")
```

In `src/uploading_lambda.py`, similarly update `connect_to_db()` with the name of the secret containing the data warehouse credentials.

```python
credentials = retrieve_secret(sm_client, "YOUR-DW-SECRET-NAME-HERE")
```

[Create three GitHub Actions secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions#creating-secrets-for-a-repository) to store the AWS credentials already used in your [project configuration](#-prerequisites), namely:

1. `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
2. `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
3. `AWS_REGION`

### üåã Terraform Setup

In `terraform/main.tf`, update `backend "s3"` to refer to your [S3 remote state bucket](#-prequisites) and AWS region.

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~>5.0"
    }
  }

  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "YOUR-BUCKET-NAME-HERE"
    key    = "terraform.tfstate"
    region = "YOUR-AWS-REGION-HERE"
  }
}
```

In `terraform/vars.tf`, first update `project-prefix` to a unique prefix for your fork's variables.

```hcl
variable "project_prefix" {
  type    = string
  default = "YOUR-CHOSEN-PREFIX-" 
}
```

Then update `error-alerts-recipient` to give the email address you'd like to receive automatic error notifications.

```hcl
variable "error-alerts-recipient" {
  type    = string
  default = "YOUR.EMAIL.ADDRESS@HERE.COM" 
}
```

### üöÄ Testing and Deployment

To run full checks, including safety, linting, testing and coverage, run:

```sh
make run-checks
```

If you wish to run individual tests ‚Äì unlikely to be necessary for the purposes of initial setup and deployment ‚Äì use the following command:

```sh
source ./venv/bin/activate && pytest -vvvrP test/TEST_FILE_NAME_HERE.py
```

To deploy the full AWS cloud pipeline using Terraform, first change into the `terraform` directory.

```sh
cd terraform
```

Initialise terraform, then plan and apply.

```sh
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

Navigate to [Step Functions](https://console.aws.amazon.com/states) in the AWS Console, and click on the newly created state machine. Provided your databases are correctly set up and the IAM user associated with your credentials has all the necessary permissions, you should see a successful execution of the pipeline.

<p align="center"><img src="./docs/images/states-execution-succeeded.png" /></p>

Subsequent pushes to the `main` branch of the GitHub repo will trigger a CI/CD pipeline in GitHub Actions, once again linting, checking and testing the code and deploying any changes to AWS using `terraform apply`.
