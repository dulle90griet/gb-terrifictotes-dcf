dim_currency column order:

    - currency_id INT NOT NULL (from currency.currency_id)
    - currency_code VARCHAR NOT NULL changed from VARCHAR[3] (from currency.currency_code)
    - currency_name VARCHAR  (NEW COLUMN! we think we might need a reference dictionary here to be able to add currency_names from currency_codes)

ALL COLUMNS FROM CURRENCY
