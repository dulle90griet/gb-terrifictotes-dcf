date columns in order:
- date_id (date) primary key (generated by date algorithm or insertion?)
- year (int) (extracted from source date row)
- month (int) (extracted from source date row)
- day (int) (extracted from source date row)
- day_of_week (int) (generated by date algorithm - we expect a digit from 1-7 or 0-6?)
- day_name (varchar) (generated by date algorithm)
- month_name (varchar) (generated by date algorithm)
- quarter (int) (generated by date algorithm)

Source Tables and Rows
======================

The DIM_DATE table is potentially unique among dim tables, in that (a) breaking timestamps down into the required columns, (b) checking whether each date already exists with an id in the dim_dates table and (c) creating a new row with an id if it doesn't, will require its own util function (or equivalent) which will need to be invoked in the course of processing every other table.
The SALES_ORDER table contains 2 rows which are "yyyy-mm-dd" varchars only, but this is not a problem as time is not stored in DIM_DATE.

SALES_ORDER:
- created_at (timestamp) 
- last_updated (timestamp)
- agreed_delivery_date (varchar) 
- agreed_payment_date (varchar)

ADDRESS:
- created_at (timestamp)
- last_updated (timestamp)

COUNTERPARTY:
- created_at (timestamp)
- last_updated (timestamp)

STAFF:
- created_at (timestamp)
- last_updated (timestamp)

DEPARTMENT (maybe not needed for MVP?):
- created_at (timestamp)
- last_updated (timestamp)

CURRENCY
- created_at (timestamp)
- last_updated (timestamp)

DESIGN:
- created_at (timestamp)
- last_updated (timestamp)
