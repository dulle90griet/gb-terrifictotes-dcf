date columns in order:
- date_id (date) primary key
- year (int) (extracted from source date row)
- month (int) (extracted from source date row)
- day (int) (extracted from source date row)
- day_of_week (int) (generated by datetime.isoweekday() - a digit from 1 (Mon) to 7 (Sun))
- day_name (varchar) (generated by datetime.strftime("%A"))
- month_name (varchar) (generated by datetime.strftime("%B"))
- quarter (int) (calculated based on month, i.e. month 1-3 is quarter 1)

AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED
Script run each time the processed bucket is created? Or each time the lambda function is run it checks if the json exists in dim_date and, if not, generates it?
